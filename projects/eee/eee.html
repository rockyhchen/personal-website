			<p class="stream-body">What if you don't have tennitus? EEE is avialble to be used for all; there are major health benifits to using EEE even if you don't have tennitus. EEE is a mobile application that aims to improve the quality of life during waking and sleeping hours. Sleeping better can grealty increase an indviduals immune system, memory, mood, weight control and concentration. Many studies have shown the advantages of listenting to ambient noise while studying, working or relaxing.</p>

			<p id="user-personas" class="stream-title">User Personas</p>
			<p class="stream-body">Three fictional user personas were produced to create a memorable cast of characters to focus on. Selecting a diverse mix was required for the large target audience. These aided in the development of scenarios and end goals of design for all. They effectively incorporated empathy in the design process when making and defending design decisions.</p>

			<p id="ab-test" class="stream-title">Content Display</p>
			<p class="stream-body">During the group usuabilitiy interviews, there was a debate on how the descriptions should be displayed on the screen where you could preview and select which sound/noise profile you prefered. Please refer to figure 1.0: originally users were able to tap on the arrows [1] to expand the description [2] for a selected sound/noise. The arrow [1] may be tapped again to hide the description [2]. Some users complained this was too much tapping. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="stream-subtitle">Split A/B Testing</p>
			<p class="stream-body">In response to this feedback, I created a new prototype. Please refer to figure 1.1: users are now able to tap a button [3] to expand all the descriptions [2] at once. The button [3] can be tapped again to hide all the descriptions [2]. A gradient opacity masked [4] was used to signify there was more information acces siable by scrolling. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I conducted another study with a live prototypes and 3 seperate groups. I created 2 live prototypes with simple HTML, CSS and Javascript. This windows were shrunk on the desktop screen to resemble mobile devices. Group A (reference group) was presented the design from both figure 1.0 and 1.1. Group B was presented with only design 1.0. Group C was presented with only design 1.1. 
			<br>	
			<br>	
			Group A: 100% of individuals said they were able to consume information faster with design 1.1 over design 1.0. Group B: 80% of individuals expanded the first or second descriptions and read them carefully. For every description afterwards, they only quickly skimmed through them. Group C: 100% of individuals skimmed through all descriptions. For Group A and B: When presented with design figure 1.0, 100% of individuals expanded all the descriptions but did not bother closing any of them. After analyzing these results, design (figure) 1.1 was implemented.</p>

			<p id="flat-vs-skeu" class="stream-title">Flat vs Skeumorphic</p>
			<p class="stream-body">There has been on-going trend of flat design, slowly weeding out skeumorphic approaches. Flat design is often purely visual, resonating with designer's love of minimalist concepts. The simplistic and clean results create visually appealing and outstanding results. However, taking away all these cues and signifyers have a great impact on usability. Many young users experience little difficulty with flat design, they are familiar with common affordance patterns across mutliple platforms and applications. However, an older audience unfamilar with common trends may have difficulty defining and differenciating interface elements. The solution was to use subtle gradients, layering, dropshadows and a hint of skeumorphic design to retain a sense of the tangible world to please older audiences while still looking visually pleasing and up-to-date to please younger audiences.
			<br>
			<br>
			A study group was created consisting of individuals above the age of 30 who were uncomfortable with technology. In figure 2.0, 40% of individuals were unable to recognize the flat version as an interactable UI element, 60% took more than 10 seconds to realize it was interactable. In figure 2.1, 20% of the individuals were unable to recognize the flat version as an interactive UI elemtnt. In both figure 2.0 and 2.1, 100% of the subjects were able to recognize the later version (”touch of skeuomorphism”) as an interactable UI elment within 5 seconds.</p>

			<p class="stream-subtitle">Increasing Usability</p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<span class="bold">Explicit Affordance</span>
Timed explicit affordance was used in order to please a younger audience (prefers minimilistic design) and an older audience (prefers straight-forward design).The alarm screen initially appears clean and simple. If they user is idle for 5 seconds, a ripple effect animates on the dial as a clue to interact with this element. Additionally intstruction text appears to guide the user. These are unambiguous signifiers that are easy to understand. </p>
			
			<img src="images/dials-06.png">
				
			<p><span class="bold">Metaphorical Affordance</span>
This refers to connecting real-word objects or physical traits to user interface elements in order to communicate affordance. This allows faster communication without the need of explicit affordance. For example: instead of having a button that said “tap to create your tennitus tone”, a more effective solution would have an element that appears to be “tappable” labeled “create”. For more information on how EEE utilizes metaphorical affordance, refer to “Flat vs Skeumorp hic” on page 2.
			<br>
			<br>	
			<span class="bold">Hidden Affordance</span>
A hamburger menu is a common type of hidden affordance; you must tap on it to reveal a hidden menu of items. Although this simplifies the visual complexity of a design and increases valuable real estate, it was avoided to increase usability. The current nagivation menu requires less tapping to travel from different screens; it is also less confusing for older audiences as key information is not hidden.

			<p id="heat-mapping" class="stream-title">Heat Mapping</p>
			<p class="stream-subtitle">Making Life Easier for your Thumbs</p>
			<p class="stream-body">Research has shown that we typically hold our phones with the bottom of the thumb anchored on the lower right hand corner (67%), or left hand corner for left handed people (33%). I used a heat map displaying the comfort of our phones while creating wireframes to increase reachability and comfort for the users. Some buttons used to be on the top of the phone but after considering the heat maps, as much of the interactable user interface elements were placed in the natural zones as possible.</p>

			<p id="iconography" class="stream-title">Iconography</p>
			<p class="stream-subtitle">Grids, Lines and Circles</p>
			<p class="stream-body">A series of icons were created on the backbone of similar elments (grid, weight, angles, curves and style). This design process created a sense of cohesiveness and unity. The icons improved navigation, allowed information to be processed faster and heightened user delight.</p>
